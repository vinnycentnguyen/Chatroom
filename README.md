# Running Ethan's Favorite Chatroom on your own machine

1. Clone this repository onto your local machine, into a repository of your choice
2. Ensure that you have `Node.js` and `NPM` (Node package manager) installed. You can do this by typing opening up your command line interface and typing in the commands `node -v` and `npm -v` to check which versions you have of either.
3. Once you've ensured both are installed (you can install them through the [Node.js Website](https://nodejs.org/en)), enter the `client` repository using your command line interface.
4. Once inside, you can reference the `README.md` that's inside the `client` folder to run, test, and build the server however you like.

Okay this ^ is actually wrong, but it's a good start for how I want to format the README
